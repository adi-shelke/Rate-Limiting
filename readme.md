# Rate Limiting API with Hono and Upstash Redis

This project demonstrates how to implement rate limiting in a serverless API using Hono, a fast, simple, and powerful web framework for Cloudflare Workers, and Upstash Redis, a serverless Redis service.

## Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Protects the `/todos/:id` endpoint from excessive requests by IP address.
- **Serverless**: Built for Cloudflare Workers, leveraging the power and scalability of serverless architecture.
- **Redis-backed**: Utilizes Upstash Redis for storing rate limit counters in a fast, scalable, and serverless data store.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A Cloudflare Workers account.
- An Upstash account for Redis.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rate-limiting.git
cd rate-limiting
